Companion Library for Springer Book "Applied Data Analysis and Modeling" by T. Agami Reddy and Gregor P. Henze
to be found [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-34869-3).

Filling this library is a continuous process. Here is an overview over all notebooks currently in the
Library, split between workbooks solving specific problems from the book, and workbooks explaining 
general concepts.
